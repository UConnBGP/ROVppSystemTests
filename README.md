ROV++ System Tests
=========================

This repo holds a suite of system tests for the ROV++ project.
This repo depends on the following repositories:

* [BGPExtrapolator](https://github.com/c-morris/BGPExtrapolator/tree/rovpp2) (`rovpp2` branch)
* [lib_bgp_data](https://github.com/jfuruness/lib_bgp_data) (`master` branch)

The **lib_bgp_data** needs to be installed properly, along with its required dependencies before running the tests.

### Environments

An environment that's already setup for these tests is located on `ahlocal`
> Maybe in the future a VM image will be provided.

### Tests

Each test is located in a directory in this repo.
To find more information about a given test, just look in the corresponding directory
